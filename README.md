# libft
42 libft; recreation of libc functions plus some extras for 42 Silicon Valley.

Horribly inefficient, lovingly made.

Added to sporadically, as more utilities are needed. Contains two submodules (so far); to make sure you don't end up with empty folders (and so the Makefile still works), make sure you use `git clone --recursive`. [Here](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/GitSubmodules/article.html) is a handy resource on how to work with submodules, if you're interested.
